Hello!

This program is made to help you using windows options.

It provides all options which windows provide by itself so this is not a virus or something like that!

Its open source so feel free and use it, but pm when you posting somewhere just to see what you have done!

Have a feedback? Pm at my email address pepepro200@gmail.com I'm ready to answer on all messages.
